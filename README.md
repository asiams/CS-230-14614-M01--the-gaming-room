Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room Client is working on a new guessing game that will be accessible across multiple device types and operating systems. To ensure smooth gameplay across platforms, the application must be built with cross-compatibility in mind, enabling real-time communication between different systems. The software will also need to handle user account management, including storing player data securely.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think my evaluations were very well done and had a lot of time put in.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I would say breaking down the overall system into smaller, manageable components and defining their responsibilities ahead of time. This made the coding process more efficient and reduced the risk of running into major structural issues later on.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The architecture section, I would add more details and make it more clear.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the project requirements and identifying key features like cross-platform access, smooth gameplay, and secure user management. Considering user needs is essential because software must solve real problems and meet user expectations to be effective and successful.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software by first breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable components and then outlining how each part would interact within the overall system. In the future, I would continue using this modular approach but also incorporate techniques like creating wireframes, using UML diagrams, and also conduct early user feedback sessions to better analyze and refine the design before development begins.
